# PID-Particle-Swarm
*Optimizes the PID gains of an idle speed control system for an internal combustion engine.*

Particle Swarm Optimization is used to find the PID gains to minimize the excursion and settling time of the engine speed repsonse to perturbations in the load. The MATLAB code can be found in assign_pid.m and a full report is included in Particle_Swarm_Report.pdf.

Note: the MATLAB file will not execute, as the Simulink model is not included. However, the particle swarm code can be modified to fit any application model.
